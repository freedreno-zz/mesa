/**
 * Public interface interface for resequencer layer.
 *
 * The resequencer layer reorders state updates, draws, etc, for better
 * efficiency on tiling GPUs.  Many GL apps/games which are not properly
 * optimized for tilers will do things like unnecessary render target
 * switches or mid-batch texture uploads.
 *
 * This is solved by tracking dependencies between rendering to surfaces
 * and use of those surfaces, and replaying the sequence of state updates
 * and draws to the driver in a more optimal order.
 *
 * The resequencer can also clone/shadow resources to avoid flushes.  For
 * example, a mid-batch texture upload can clone the pipe_resource (so
 * an existing rsq_resource now refers to a new driver pipe_resource).
